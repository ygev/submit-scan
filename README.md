## What is Submit Scan?
Submit Scan is an Among Us themed personality test, similar to Shindanmaker. It allows you to enter your in-game statistics and receive some insights about what kind of player you are. 

## What is the diagnosis and how is it calculated? 
The diagnosis places you on a scale among six variables: 
- **Big Brain** — Based on impostor and crewmate wins compared to total games played.
- **Not Sus** — Based on how little you get ejected.
- **Deadly** — Based on your kill statistics as impostor.
- **Handy** — Based on how many sabotages you fix per game, as well as tasks completed.
- **Vigilant** — Based on emergencies called, as well as bodies reported.

## What else is there? 
In addition to a diagnosis, you will receive percentages on the following:
- **Crewmate Win Rate**
- **Impostor Win Rate**
- **Ejection Rate**
- **Murder Victim Rate**
- **Games Completion Rate**.
